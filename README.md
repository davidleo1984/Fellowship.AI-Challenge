# Fellowship.AI Challenge: Cohort 19

This is the submission of the Fellowship.AI Challenge: Cohort 19. 

## The Challenge

Use a pretrained ResNet 50 and train on the STL10 dataset for 5 epochs and then visualize the layer activations using GRADCAM for a mislabeled image of your weakest class. What additional steps would you take to improve the model without changing the number of epochs?
